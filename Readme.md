## How it stores and uses data

When syncing from a TidGi-Desktop app:

1. HTML, contains some of core tw things like `$:/boot` and raw HTML created by [$:/tags/RawMarkup](https://tiddlywiki.com/#SystemTag%3A%20%24%3A%2Ftags%2FRawMarkup)
    1. To update the TiddlyWiki version or the raw markup, you need to perform a full-resync (delete and recreate)
1. SQLite, When adding wiki, we fetch all skinny-tiddlers of your tid/md file, then store them in SQLite DB to speed up booting and save memory.
1. JSON, When adding wiki, we fetch all plugins's full content as JSON, this will not be updated
1. Files, binary files like images are stored as files on your phone.

Later, we use a Sync-Adaptor to only load the file you need lazily, to increase performance on a huge wiki. Also, reduce the memory and CPU consumption of your phone.

### Drawbacks

Currently, only normal tiddlers in SQLite are certainly synced back to TidGi-Desktop. HTML Javascript tiddler, and JSON plugins are never tested (Feel free to have a try and report to me!). So if you want to add new plugins, you may need to backup data to Desktop, add plugins on Desktop, and perform a full resync (delete and recreate) from TidGi-Desktop (If this is not necessary, report to me!).

And we don't support creating a new wiki, like [Tiddloid](https://github.com/donmor/Tiddloid) does. You need an existing [TidGi-Desktop](https://github.com/tiddly-gittly/TidGi-Desktop) wiki to get started.

## Permissions

All these features can be accessible from tiddlywiki plugin, so you can develop plugins to notify you about ToDo, or record locations of visited places, etc.

1. Notification: We use notification to switch between full-screen wiki and menu, and also allow plugin to show notification.
2. Location: To store server location, later can show them on a map.
